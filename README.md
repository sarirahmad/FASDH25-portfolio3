# Mini Project 3

This project analyzes thematic similarity and content patterns in a collection of news articles using TF-IDF, article frequency, and text length data. By calculating TF-IDF similarity scores between article pairs, we track how closely articles align in content over time. Visualizations such as histograms and heatmaps highlight trends in similarity across months. We also examine the number and length of articles published each month to explore how content volume may influence thematic overlap. Finally, topic modeling is applied to identify dominant themes during periods of high similarity, offering deeper insight into recurring narratives and shifts in focus within the corpus.

## Analyzing Similarity and Themes in Articles using TF-IDF and Topic Modeling (Sarir)

### Overview:

This part focuses on measuring how similar articles are to one another using TF-IDF, tracking article frequency and length over time, and analyzing thematic trends through topic modeling. The goal is to understand when and why articles become more aligned in content.

### Objectives

* Calculate TF-IDF similarity scores between article pairs.

* Track how similarity changes over time (month-to-month).

* Count the number of articles and analyze their lengths across months.

* Apply topic modeling to uncover dominant themes during peaks in similarity.

### Tools and Libraries

* Python
* pandas, plotly, datetime

### Output (example):
month       avg_similarity     num_articles     avg_length      top_topics
2023-10     0.61               135              948 words       gaza | attack | israel | civilians
2023-11     0.66               122              1003 words      aid | water | hospital | strike
2023-12     0.53               145              876 words       UN | ceasefire | shelter | airstrikes
